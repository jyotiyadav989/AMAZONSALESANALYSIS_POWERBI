#  HRAnalytics
I have created an HR Analytics Dashboard using various KPIs and data visualization techniques to provide a comprehensive overview of our workforce metrics. The dashboard showcases key information such as overall employee count, attrition rates, department-wise breakdowns, age group distributions, and job satisfaction ratings. I've utilized pie charts, bar graphs, and donut charts to present data clearly and effectively.
